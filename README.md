# Project Classmate Vampire Detection System

## Introduction

Welcome to the Classmate Vampire Detection System! This project aims to help you determine if your classmate might be a vampire based on four key features: shadow, garlic, and complexion. Please follow the instructions below to conduct a thorough analysis and make an informed decision.

## Features

### 1. Shadow

Vampires are known for their lack of reflection in mirrors and photos. To check if your classmate is a vampire, observe their shadow. If they have no shadow or if the shadow appears faint or distorted, it could be an indication of vampiric traits.

### 2. Garlic

Traditionally, vampires are repelled by garlic. Casually bring garlic into your conversation or offer some garlic-flavored snacks. If your classmate shows signs of discomfort, avoidance, or a strong negative reaction, it might be a clue that they have a vampiric aversion to garlic.

### 3. Complexion

Vampires are often portrayed with pale or ashen complexions due to their nocturnal lifestyle. Observe your classmate's skin tone, especially in natural light. If they consistently have a remarkably pale or unnatural complexion, it could be a sign of vampiric characteristics.

## How to Use

1. **Observation**: discreetly observe your classmate in various situations, paying attention to the specified features.
   
2. **Input**: enter a first and last name, check the circles to see if the signs apply to the classmate and hit confirm to find out if your classmate is a blood-sucking vermin!
